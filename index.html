         Korea has fantasised me since I started seeing Kdramas. I started getting very attached to them in a very short span of time which made me question myself why is this so 
         addictive and likeable, to my amusement I found liking to the country itself. In India we can not see such an environment very commonly, evenn though they are shooting spots
         they felt very close to home. The place in Korea where beautifully illustrated through those drama, and I consider that these dramas are one of the main reason many know about 
         Korea. There are millions of people like me in India who have became attached to korea through their dramas and kpop , which I think is a big achievement for the country. They really have
         established themselves very well in the world.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p id="par">
        Korea, or the Korean Peninsula, is a region in East Asia. Since 1945 it has been divided into the two parts which soon became the two sovereign states: North Korea (officially the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea") and South Korea (officially the "Republic of Korea"). Korea consists of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and several minor islands near the peninsula. It is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea).
        <br> <br>
        During the first half of the 1st millennium, Korea was divided between the three competing states of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In the second half of the 1st millennium, Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo, leading to the "Unified Silla" period. Meanwhile, Balhae formed in the north, superseding former Goguryeo. Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war, ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms. Toward the end of the 1st millennium, Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo, which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state. Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo. Goryeo (also spelled as Koryŏ), whose name developed into the modern exonym "Korea", was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234.
        However, multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting. Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo, severe political strife followed, and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye, who established Joseon in 17 July 1392.        
       <br><br> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
        The first 200 years of the Joseon era were marked by relative peace. During this period, the Korean alphabet was created by Sejong the Great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of Confucianism. During the later part of the dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the Western nickname of the "Hermit Kingdom". By the late 19th century, the country became the object of imperial design by the Empire of Japan. After the First Sino-Japanese War, despite the Korean Empire's effort to modernize, the country was annexed by Japan in 22 August 1910 and directly ruled by it until the end of World War II in 2 September 1945.
        <br><br>
        In 1945, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed on the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea in the aftermath of World War II, leaving Korea partitioned along the 38th parallel. The North was under Soviet occupation and the South under U.S. occupation. These circumstances became the basis for the division of Korea by the two superpowers with two different ideologies, exacerbated by their inability to agree on the terms of Korean independence. The Communist-inspired government in the North received backing from the Soviet Union in opposition to the pro-Western government in the South, leading to Korea's division into two political entities in 1948: North Korea, and South Korea. Tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. With involvement by foreign troops, the war ended in a stalemate in 1953, but without a formalized peace treaty. This status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula. Both governments of the two Koreas continue to claim to be the sole legitimate government of the region.

          North Korea remains among the world’s most repressive countries. Kim Jong Un’s government sharply curtails freedom of expression, religion, and conscience, peaceful assembly, and association. It prohibits political opposition, independent media, NGOs, and trade unions. A 2014 UN Commission of Inquiry found that the government committed violations amounting to crimes against humanity, including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, rape, and forced abortions. North Korea operates secret prison camps where presumed government opponents face torture, forced labor, and starvation. 
          <br><br>
          In 2020, the government invoked Covid-19 to put in place extreme and unnecessary measures that further isolated the country, blocking information into and out the country, closing its border with China, and harshly controlling food and product distribution.

          For decades, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - more commonly known as North Korea - has been one of the world's most secretive countries.
          Its government doesn't like people from outside the country going there and finding out what's going on.
          <br><br>
          It shares a border with a country called South Korea - and the two countries have not got on with each other for a long time.
          A North Korean leader had not stepped foot in South Korea for 65 years and the leaders of the countries had not met for 10 years.
          But that changed in April 2018 when North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met with the president of South Korea Moon Jae-in at the border between the two countries. The meeting was a significant moment in modern history.

          Korea’s vibrant cultural legacy, comprising music, art, literature, dance, architecture, clothing, and cuisine, offers a delightful combination of tradition and modernity. South Korea preserves a wealth of priceless cultural heritage, the majority of which have been inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List to be protected for future generations.
          <br><br>
          Since the earliest settlements during prehistoric times, the people of Korea have developed a unique culture based on their outstanding artistic sensibility. The geographical conditions of the peninsula provided Koreans with opportunities to receive both continental and maritime cultures and ample resources, thereby forming original cultures of interest to and value for the rest of humanity, both then and now. Korea’s vibrant cultural legacy, comprising music, art, literature, dance, architecture, clothing, and cuisine, offers a delightful combination of tradition and modernity.

          South Korea has achieved rapid growth in a short period. The country has displayed global competitiveness in various fields such as mobile phones, semiconductors, automobiles, chemicals, and steelmaking. In recent years, its cultural content, including music, gaming, and webtoons, is emerging as an essential industry in itself, taking the lead in the Korean economy.
          <br><br>
          The Constitution of South Korea stipulates that “the right of property of all citizens shall be guaranteed.” In other words, South Korea is based on a market economy, and thus it allows individuals and businesses to freely conduct economic activities and guarantees their profits and properties.
