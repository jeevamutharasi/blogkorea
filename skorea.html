        <h1>South Korea: The Land of the Morning Calm</h1>
        In 1934 A.D., an emperor of the Ming dynasty of China, the Celestial Empire of the East, gave Korea the title of ''Chaohsien'' meaning morning freshness. The title was most suited to South Korea because of its spellbinding natural beauty of picturesque high mountains and clear waters and its splen-did tranquillity, particularly in the morning which further confirmed the title on South Korea as the ''Land of Morning Calm''.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p id="par">
          South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea, is a nation in eastern Asia with a long history of conflict that occupies the southern portion of the Korean Peninsula.
          Liberated from Japan in 1945 at the end of World War II, South Korea was invaded by communist forces in North Korea a few years later. Aid requested by the United Nations helped end the three-year war and support the south on its way to democracy. A critical divide between the two nations along the center of the peninsula remains.
          <br>
          In the decades following independence, strict authoritarian rule took over the recovery of an embattled nation and its sinking economy. The first free national elections took place in 1987, passing control from a dictatorship to the people. In 2016, the country’s first female president was the focus of a corruption scandal, leading to her removal from office in March 2017.
          <br>
          The country’s capital, Seoul, is located near the center of the Korean Peninsula, chosen as such during the Joseon dynasty (1392-1897) for its impressive feng shui - the idea that the positioning of objects ensures health and harmony. It is home to the headquarters of Samsung, Hyundai and Kia, representing two of South Korea’s important exports: technology and cars.

      <h2>Facts</h2>
      <p id="par">
        Do you know any interesting facts about South Korea?
       <br>
        Many people are curious about South Korea these days. Some like K-Pop and K-Dramas, while others may be interested in speaking Korean so they can take a trip to Seoul.
        <br>
        In any case, we’ve got you covered!
        <br>
        Without further ado, here are the most interesting facts on South Korea! 
        <br><br>
        <u>1. It’s common to ask about blood types</u>
        <br> <br>
        One of the common facts is that South Koreans think there is some significance to their blood type. Their neighbors in Japan are also similar in that way. While people in other countries may or may not know their blood type, every South Korean certainly does know his or hers!      
        <br><br>
        <u>2. South Koreans are one year old when born</u>
        <br><br>
        One of the unique facts about South Koreans is that they’re automatically one year old at birth.  This means that a newborn baby is considered one year old in South Korea. There are different schools of thought as to why this is. One explanation is that people think it’s because the baby is in the mother’s womb for 9 months, which is about 1 year. Therefore in South Korea, the baby is 1 year old when born.
        <br><br>
        <u>3.Largest Drinkers in Asia</u>
        <br><br>
        Football (soccer), spicy food, and definitely drinking! Many are surprised to see that Koreans are considered one of the top drinkers in Asia by far. South Korea actually has a strong drinking culture compared to its neighboring countries in Asia. This can be rooted in their tradition and culture, where most holidays are celebrated with alcohol. According to the World Health Organization, South Koreans consume an average of 12.3L of alcohol per year and are ranked #17 in the world!

        <u>4. The North and South Korea Are Still at War</u>
        <br><br>
        Although we often hear news about the possible threats from North Korea, most South Koreans don’t think much of it. While living here in South Korea, it almost feels like it’s a completely safe situation. The two Koreas may not be battling it out on a day-to-day basis, but they still haven’t made up. In the year 1953, the two sides agreed to a truce. However, as you head to the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone border) in South Korea, you’ll notice that there is still quite a bit of tension there. Despite this, South Korea is still surprisingly safe.
        <br><br>
        <u>5.Plastic Cash</u>
        <br><br>
        Not only is South Korea one of the most wired countries in the world, but it’s also one of the places with the highest credit card usage. If you’ve visited South Korea before, you’ve probably noticed that it’s hard to find a place that doesn’t accept credit cards. Taxis, food delivery, and almost all restaurants are set up to accept credit cards. If you don’t have a credit card and live in South Korea, getting one is a worthwhile investment.
        <br><br>
        <u>6. South Korea’s Internet is Blazing Fast </u>
        <br><br>
        Wherever you are in the world, you’ve probably experienced the frustration of slow internet at some point. Whether it’s from being remote or having periodic issues with your internet service provider, internet connectivity problems can be a serious inconvenience and put anybody in a bad mood.
        <br>
        That being said, you’re in for a virtual treat when you visit South Korea! On average, South Korea has the fastest internet connection speed, and they’re beating every other country’s internet speed by a significant amount. Stop by an internet cafe while you’re in Seoul and experience what it’s like to have super-powered internet.

          <u>History of Korean Culture</u>
          <br><br>
          The Korean culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures in the whole wide world. Today, starker cultural differences exist in today’s Korea, which has been split into North and South Korea. However, originally this cultural and historical heritage was shared quite identically across the entire Korean peninsula and even southern Manchuria.
          <br><br>
          Korean culture comprises all of its history, customs, traditions, and beliefs. It has been shaped by each of its different dynasties, wars, changes in religious beliefs, the modernization of the world as a whole, and many other customs and traditions that have passed on between generations, experiencing slight changes with each generational pass. The lasting tensions between North and South Korea, which were split into their separate countries in 1945, continue to shape up both countries today.

        <p id="par">
          <u>Korean Beliefs</u>
          <br><br>
          The spiritual ground and beliefs of Koreans are built mainly around the religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Christianity. Of these, especially Confucianism has a long record of influence in Korea, and its political and social philosophies can still clearly be seen in today’s Korea. However, Buddhism and Christianity are also highly visible in the society where the Buddhist South Koreans account for 46% of the population.
          <br><br>
          Although especially the younger generations are becoming more and more individualistic, Korea is still a largely collective society, with family, workplace, in business and others’ perception of you holding a lot of importance. Therefore, it is not rare to still see the type of family dynamics where the eldest son of the family holds additional responsibilities over the family. He is also expected to take care of the parents when they reach retirement age.

          <u>Korean traditions and customs</u>
          <br><br>
          There are two major holidays in South Korea every year: Lunar New Year’s Day (설날, seollal) in January-February and Korean Thanksgiving (추석) in September-October. Both holidays are celebrated together with family, with respecting ancestors, certain holiday foods and family games playing a big part of the day.
          <br><br>
          One of the most important parts of 설날, both traditionally and today, is to perform a ritual called 세배 (sebae). In it, the whole family, dressed in 한복, performs a deep traditional bow, while wishing for the year to bring in a lot of luck. For food, it is normal to eat rice cake soup, savory pancakes, and stir-fried glass noodles with vegetables.
          <br>
          On 추석, on the other hand, it is 차례 (charye), an ancestral memorial rite, that is the most important part of the holiday. It involves a whole lot of preparation in order to create a table of offerings, and on the table will also be two candles at the edges, an incense holder in the middle, and the memorial tablet, symbolizing the spiritual presence of the ancestors, at the very center. For food, stuffed rice cakes (called 송편, songpyeon) are made as the most traditional one, with a whole lot of others being enjoyed as well.

      <h2>Globalisation</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <p id="par">
          Korea is one of the few countries that has successfully transformed itself from a low-income to a high-income economy and a global leader in innovation and technology. The Korea office works with Korean partner institutions to help developing countries learn from Korea’s experience and expertise.
          <br>
          South Korea today is Asia’s fourth largest and the world’s 15th largest economy and is the world’s ninth largest trading country. South Korea has grown into a global hub of free trade with full access to two-thirds of the world’s markets, representing about half the global population.

        <p id="par">
          Globalization has been a huge factor in South Korea’s growth and economic success. Modern South Korea is a leader in many industries, from technology and automobiles to music and entertainment.
          <br>
          According to the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), Korea’s national competitiveness was ranked 22nd among 59 countries in 2011, its highest standing ever. This ranking has gone up for the past three years.
          <br>
          In regards to technology, South Korean corporate giant Samsung is supporting the country’s globalization with its partnerships abroad. Last year, Samsung announced collaboration plans with Dreamworks Animation in the U.S. to jointly produce 3-D televisions.

          Additionally, South Korea, which once looked up to the success of high technology in Silicon Valley, is now the fastest country to complete a high-speed communications network infrastructure.
          <br>
          Another prime area of South Korea’s growth and globalization can be seen in the automobile sector, particularly in the case of Hyundai Motor Co. and affiliate Kia Motors. Last year, Hyundai-Kia surpassed Toyota as the biggest Asian carmaker in Europe. This year, the company saw record growth and market shares in the North American market.
          <br> <br>
          While these companies are proving their great success abroad, globalization in the domestic market has not yet reached its full potential. There is still a passive view that international competition would greatly hurt local businesses. Some opinions even express that Korean companies fall short of global standards and would experience difficulty competing with foreign brands.
        </p>

          A recent concert held by SM Entertainment in Paris received thousands of European fans that came to cheer on their favorite Korean singers. The enormous success of Korean pop, or K-pop, has inspired the South Korean government to use it to promote Korea’s pop culture as a new international growth industry.
          <br>
          In addition, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism has plans to promote academic research and experience programs for Korean pop culture.
          <br> <br>
          Korean movies have also contributed to the rapid increase in the domestic film market. Since the beginning of this year, more moviegoers have been opting to watch Korean films. According to the Korean Film Council, 8.48 million people watched Korean films at cinemas in February compared to 4.98 million who watched foreign films.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <p id="par">
          Even with the option of foreign films, the numbers show that Korean films are able to more than hold their own at the box office.
          <br>
          Hence, South Korea’s diverse portfolio and established success shows that it has what it takes to compete both abroad and here in its hometown. To quote another line from Ambassador Han’s speech at Stanford, South Korea’s “growth and prosperity depend on open markets and free capital flows.”
          <br>
          This applies both externally and internally, in a complete embrace of globalization. With all of the amazing accomplishments the South Korean brand has made out “there,” why wouldn’t it be able to make it “here,” on its own turf?
