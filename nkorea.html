      <p id="par">
          For decades North Korea has been one of the world's most secretive societies. It is one of the few countries still under nominally communist rule.
          North Korea's nuclear ambitions have exacerbated its rigidly maintained isolation from the rest of the world.
          <br>
          The country emerged in 1948 amid the chaos following the end of the Second World War. Its history is dominated by its Great Leader, Kim Il-sung, who shaped political affairs for almost half a century.
          Decades of this rigid state-controlled system have led to stagnation and a leadership dependent on the cult of personality. The totalitarian state also stands accused of systematic human rights abuses.

      <h2>Facts</h2>
      
      <p id="par">
      North Korea is a bizarre country to say the least. 
      <br>
      There are weird rules and systems in the country which believes the deceased founder Kim Il-sung still rules the regime in spirit form. Here are 20 of them.
      <br><br>
      <u>1. The North Korean calendar is based on its founder's date of birth</u>
      <br> <br>
      It may be the 21st century for the rest of the world but for people in North Korea, it's still the 106th Juche year. The North Korean Juche calendar begins from April 15, 1912, the date of birth of its founder Kim Il-Sung. 
      <br><br>
      <u>2. It has only 3 TV channels</u>
      <br><br>
      With everything under scrutiny, it's quite obvious that the North Korean regime keeps its media on a tight leash. There are only 3 television channels to choose from, with all programs controlled by the government.  
      <br><br>
      <u>3. Power cut every night</u>
      <br><br>
      You know how occasional power cuts are so annoying. Now imagine the state of North Koreans whose entire country goes dark at night. It's apparently due to the energy crisis in the state that it can't supply sufficient electricity to homes. This was revealed after a photo of North Korea taken from space went viral.

      <p id="par">
      <u>4. Elections with only one candidate to choose from</u>
      <br><br>
      With the country's totalitarian regime and the same family ruling since 1948, it's rather funny that the elections are held every year. The voters have only one option to choose from. Whether it's the election for a mayor, provincial governors, or local assemblies, there is only one candidate on the ballot in each district. 
      <br>
      What a farce!
      <br><br>
      <u>5. Parents have to provide desks & chairs for their kids</u>
      <br><br>
      Parents who send their kids to school are required to provide their own desks and chairs. Some students are also forced to do laborious tasks for the government, such as collecting discarded material.
      <br><br>
      <u>6. You might be held captive for being creative </u>
      <br><br>
      It's one of the popular stories that dictator Kim Jong-il kidnapped a film director, Shin Sang-ok and his wife, actor Choi Eun-hee, in 1978 to inject creativity in North Korean films. Later in 1986, after being held against their will for almost a decade, the couple gradually earned the dictator’s trust and escaped during a trip to Austria where they were promoting North Korean films.

       <p id="par">
        North Korea has been ruled by one of the world’s longest-running dynastic dictatorships. Three generations of the Kim family have ruled with absolute authority, using heavy repression and a system of patronage that ensures support from elites and the military.
        <br><br>
        The latest supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, appears to have deftly handled his early years at the top through reshuffling party and military structures and accelerating a buildup of nuclear and missile capabilities. As North Korea seeks to grow its economy and open up to the outside world, experts say Kim’s relationship with elites could be tested and will be crucial to the regime’s survival.
        <br><br>
        Three generations of Kims have held the position of supreme leader in North Korea since the end of World War II and Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule. Kim Il-sung was the founding father of North Korea, where he ruled from 1948 until his death in 1994. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-il, who served for seventeen years until a fatal heart attack in late 2011. Leadership then passed to Kim Jong-il’s twenty-eight-year-old son, Kim Jong-un, in 2012.

        <p id="par">
          Periodic purges of leadership are not out of the norm for North Korean leaders. Some have been brutal, such as the executions of Kim Jong-un’s uncle Jang Song-thaek in 2013 and Minister of Defense Hyon Yong-chol in 2015. Scores of other top officials have been retired, demoted, or otherwise shuffled out of positions of authority under Kim. In an opaque information climate, disappearances from public view should not always be considered punitive or fatal; some officials transition from public positions to cushy behind-the-scenes roles or resurface months or years later. Nevertheless, “investigations and purges create upheaval in the system,” says Michael Madden, the founder of North Korea Leadership Watch, a blog focused on leadership and political culture in North Korea. Creating this sense of instability and unpredictability for elites is one of the levers that allows Kim Jong-un to maintain his hold on power.

      <p id="par">
        Since inheriting power in late 2011, Kim Jong Un has dramatically increased the speed and scope of North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missile to carry them.
        <br><br>
        In 2016 his regime drew international condemnation by testing two nuclear devices and more than 20 ballistic missiles. The sabre-rattling has continued in 2017, with Pyongyang increasing the pace of ballistic missile tests and unveiling new, advanced weapons. On July 4 it reached a milestone by launching its first intercontinental ballistic missile.

       <p id="par">
        For the international community, particularly the US, there is growing concern that Mr Kim will soon master the technology to equip an ICBM with a nuclear warhead - a development that could imperil large swaths of the US mainland.
        <br><br>
        For North Korea’s totalitarian regime, which is focused predominantly on its own survival, the tests represent a core part of its byungjin line, a policy with the twin aims of developing nuclear weapons and improving the nation's economy. Assembling a viable nuclear deterrent would protect Pyongyang from outside threats by raising the cost of conflict.
        <br><br>
        While many tests, particularly those of short-range missiles, can be viewed as military chest-thumping, the emergence of new, longer-range missiles and the increased frequency of launches show North Korea’s technical capabilities are rapidly improving.
