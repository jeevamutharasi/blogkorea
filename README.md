# Blog-Korea

This is personal made blog on a place I adore, Korea. Korea has fantasised me since I started seeing Kdramas. I started getting very attached to them in a very short span of time which made me question myself why is this so addictive and likeable, to my amusement I found liking to the country itself. In India we can not see such an environment very commonly, evenn though they are shooting spots they felt very close to home. The place in Korea where beautifully illustrated through those drama, and I consider that these dramas are one of the main reason many know about Korea. There are millions of people like me in India who have became attached to korea through their dramas and kpop , which I think is a big achievement for the country. They really have established themselves very well in the world.
